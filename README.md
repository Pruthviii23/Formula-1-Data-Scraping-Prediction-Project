# Formula-1-Data-Scraping-Prediction-Project
This project is a part of my college data analytics assignment, focused on scraping, integrating, and analyzing Formula 1 racing data from multiple seasons (2016–2024).   The main goal is to build a comprehensive dataset that can later be used for machine learning tasks, such as predicting top finishers in future races.
